/**
 * With the application state API,
 * you can query the state of a submitted app
 * as well kill a running app by modifying the state of a running app using a PUT request with the state set to “KILLED”.
 * To perform the PUT operation, authentication has to be setup for the RM web services.
 * In addition, you must be authorized to kill the app.
 * Currently, you can only change the state to “KILLED”;
 * an attempt to change the state to any other results in a 400 error response.
 * Examples of the unauthorized and bad request errors are below.
 * When you carry out a successful PUT, the initial response may be a 202.
 * You can confirm that the app is killed by repeating the PUT request until you get a 200,
 * querying the state using the GET method or querying for app information and checking the state.
 * In the examples below, we repeat the PUT request and get a 200 response.
 * <p>
 * Please note that in order to kill an app, you must have an authentication filter setup for the HTTP interface.
 * The functionality requires that a username is set in the HttpServletRequest.
 * If no filter is setup, the response will be an “UNAUTHORIZED” response.
 * <p>
 * This feature is currently in the alpha stage and may change in the future.
