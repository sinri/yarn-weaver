 * The Cluster Reservation API Update can be used to update existing reservations.Update of a Reservation works similarly to submit described above, but the user submits the reservation-id of an existing reservation to be updated. The semantics is a try-and-swap, successful operation will modify the existing reservation based on the requested update parameter, while a failed execution will leave the existing reservation unchanged.
