 * The Cluster Reservation API can be used to list reservations. When listing reservations the user must specify the constraints in terms of a queue, reservation-id, start time or end time. The user must also specify whether or not to include the full resource allocations of the reservations being listed. The resulting page returns a response containing information related to the reservation such as the acceptance time, the user, the resource allocations, the reservation-id, as well as the reservation definition.
